{"prompt":"I see a larger than expected deduction in my payments, what does this mean? ->","completion":" Paycom has an automated tax withholding calculator we are unable to modify. The calculator takes the gross income for a given pay period and assumes this will be the recurrent bi-weekly income. Based on this assumption, it estimates the yearly income and assigns your pay period income to a specific tax bracket based on the estimated gross annual income. Therefore, the more hours you report in a specific pay period, the higher the percentage of your gross income that will be withheld as taxes. Withheld amounts can be refunded after submitting your taxes in the following year. We thus strongly recommend you to never forget to report your hours for a long period of time. Your tax deductions might surprise you! Nevertheless, you can be confident that your tax return will return all the exceeding deductions. END"}

To do that, just add them to the following pay period and comment on where these hours come from. This will help your manager know the origin of these extra hours. Keep in mind the average hours worked per week should be 7.5 END"}
