"I see a larger than expected deduction in my payments, what does this mean?","Paycom has an automated tax withholding calculator we are unable to modify. The calculator takes the gross income for a given pay period and assumes this will be the recurrent bi-weekly income. Based on this assumption, it estimates the yearly income and assigns your pay period income to a specific tax bracket based on the estimated gross annual income. Therefore, the more hours you report in a specific pay period, the higher the percentage of your gross income that will be withheld as taxes. Withheld amounts can be refunded after submitting your taxes in the following year. We thus strongly recommend you to never forget to report your hours for a long period of time. Your tax deductions might surprise you! Nevertheless, you can be confident that your tax return will return all the exceeding deductions."
I can’t find my department on Paycom. How do I know which one of the options in the drop-down menu is my department?,"When submitting your hours, there's no need to select the department.

I forgot to add my hours for a specific pay period OR I could not add hours from previous Pay Periods for some reasons and now it does not allow me to add hours to previous Pay Periods. Can I add them to the current/next pay period?,"Yes, even though your total hours reported for that pay period will be over 15 hours, you can add them as catch up payments. To do that, just add them to the following pay period and comment on where these hours come from. This will help your manager know the origin of these extra hours. Keep in mind the average hours worked per week should be 7.5"
My timecard in Paycom is highlighted in yellow and I can’t add more hours. Can I still update my hours?,"When your timecard is highlighted in yellow, it means it was approved by the employee. To revoke the approval, follow the steps described [here](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SxT1gw"
How do I reset my password/login information?,"If you forgot your login info to Paycom, including username or password, you can send an email to mailto:studentpayroll@minerva.edu asking about your username or resetting your password."
My timecard on Paycom is highlighted as green/blue. Can I still update my hours?,"Timecards highlighted in blue were already approved by your manager. Please contact him/her/them directly and ask them to follow the steps in the answer to question 21 on this FAQ document to revoke their approval. Make sure you also revoke employee approval if needed (Please see question 21). Finally, ensure everyone has resubmitted their approvals before the deadline."
I am unsure about what my department and/or project is when entering hours in Paycom.
